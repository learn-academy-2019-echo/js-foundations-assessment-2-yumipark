# ASSESSMENT 2: FOUNDATIONS OF JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

### Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

Consider the function:

var text = 'outside'
function logIt(){
  console.log(text)
  var text = 'inside'
}
logIt()


1a. Look at this Javascript function and try to predict what the console show.

'inside'

1b. Test the function. Explain why the function returned what it did.

  Your answer: 'undefined'

  Researched answer: There was no argument passed in the function and there was nothing for the function to log when it is called.


2. What is JSON?

  Your answer: It's a syntax of JS.

  Researched answer: From MDN: "JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. It is based upon JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON."


3. What does CRUD stand for?

  Your answer: create, read, update, delete

  Researched answer: create, read, update, delete



4. What does are the 5 HTTP verbs?

  Your answer: post, push, pull, patch, remove

  Researched answer: get, post, put, patch, delete


5. What is a higher-order function?

  Your answer: A function that takes in another function.

  Researched answer: A higher-order function is simply a function that either takes in another function as an argument or returns another function.


6. STRETCH: What is a closure, what is it good for and how do you recognize one?

  Your answer: I do not know.

  Researched answer: From MDN: "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time."


7. STRETCH: What is an API?

  Your answer: Asian Pacific Islander (just kidding)

  Researched answer: Application programming interface. They allow applications to communicate with one another.


### Additional Feedback Questions.

1. Do you have a suggestion for a Check In question?

I found this on the internet:
What is your real favorite movie, and what movie do you pretend is your favorite to sound cultured?

2. What was your favorite topic this week?

REACT! It was daunting at first, but now I'm excited to create some webpages on my own. 

3. What was your "A-ha!" moment this week?

I'm getting better about knowing where to place code and WHY it needs to be placed there. I'm also slowly getting better about how to tackle specific coding problems, though I'm having trouble seeing the bigger picture sometimes.
